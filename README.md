```To be able to run the calculator you will first need to install ttkthemes and ttkbootstrap.

You can do this by running `pip3 install ttkthemes ttkbootstrap`

Once you have installed these libraries you can run the calculator by typing in: `pip3 run calculatorwithgui.py`

If an error pops up, it may be beacuse you are not viewing the folder which has te file in it.  In this case you can type `cd <folder name>` and then `pip3 run calculatorwithgui.py`

Thanks for checking it out!


Note: A more modern gui will be released soon!```
